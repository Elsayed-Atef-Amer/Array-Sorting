Introduction:

  Our project is array sorting using two techniques (Bubble sort , Quick sort).
    with UI which PROMPT the user 
      1- first to enter the size of array.
      2- next ask to enter the array element by element.
      3- then ask to make choice between two techniques.
    
Content of data segment:
  1. Array with length of 100.
  2. Two variables one for array size and the other for making choice.
    
Steps of  coding :
  1. Taking the first input 'ARRAY_size' from the user using 'READ_Size' function in our code.
  2. Making a function to convert the input from ASKI to its decimal value, that is called 'INDECIMAL', we will call this function for every input we would take from user.
  3. Taking the second input 'ARRAY' element by element from the user using 'READ_ARRAY' function in our code.
  4. //Condition code.
  6. //Bubble sort code.
  7. //Quick sort code.
  
C code :
  /// we would enter our c code here ///
