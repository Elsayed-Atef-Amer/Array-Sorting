**Introduction:**

  Our project is array sorting using two techniques (Bubble sort , Quick sort).
    with UI which PROMPT the user 
      1- first to enter the size of array.
      2- next ask to enter the array element by element.
      3- then ask to make choice between two techniques.
    
**Content of data segment:**
  1. Array with length of 100.
  2. Two variables one for array size and the other for making choice.
    
**Steps of  coding :**
  1. Taking the first input 'ARRAY_size' from the user using 'READ_Size' function in our code.
  2. Making a function to convert the input from ASKI to its decimal value, that is called 'INDECIMAL', we will call this function for every input we would take from user.
  3. Taking the second input 'ARRAY' element by element from the user using 'READ_ARRAY' function in our code.
  4. //Condition code.
  6. //Bubble sort code.
  7. //Quick sort code.
  
**Bubble Sort Algorithm**

  -It is a simple algorithm which is used to sort a given set of n elements provided in form of an array with n number of elements. Bubble Sort compares all the element one by   one and sort them based on their values.
  
  -If the given array has to be sorted in ascending order, then bubble sort will start by comparing the first element of the array with the second element, if the first element
   is greater than the second element, it will swap both the elements, and then move on to compare the second and the third element, and so on.
   
   -If we have total n elements, then we need to repeat this process for n-1 times.
   
   -It is known as bubble sort, because with every complete iteration the largest element in the given array, bubbles up towards the last place or the highest index, just like a water bubble rises up to the water surface.
   
  -Sorting takes place by stepping through all the elements one-by-one and comparing it with the adjacent element and swapping them if required.
